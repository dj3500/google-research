# Fair submodular maximization

This is an efficient C++ implementation of the algorithms and baselines from
"Fairness in Streaming Submodular Maximization: Algorithms and Hardness".

The code should be provided with an oracle that returns the value of a subset of
elements. There are basic oracles provided. One can use these as examples.
The detailed explanations are provided in the source code.

To compile the code, run `make`. Then execute `fair-submodular-2020.exe`.
